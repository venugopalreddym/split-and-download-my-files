# split-and-download-my-files

the idea of building a client-server apllication .let say user wants to download a file of 20GB,but his daily mobile internet usage is 2GB.
our website and android application should offer a service where he can call his friends to download who have same daily internet usage of 2gb
to download a large file into small fragments by each one of friends .Now each mobile holds a fragments of file using peer to peer wireless
communication our devices communicate and merge the fragments to get original file in all devices using wifi hardware.
